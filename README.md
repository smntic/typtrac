# typtrac
typtrac hates you. It wants to watch you suffer.

# Installation
To install the most annoying typing test of all time using CMake:
``` bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/smntic/typtrac
cd typtrac

# cmake
cmake -S . -B build

# make
cd build
sudo make install
```

# Configuration
You may alter the sadist's words by editing the `~/.local/share/typtrac/language.txt` file.\
Each line in the file should contain one word.

The language is otherwise copied from `/usr/local/share/typtrac/language.txt`.
